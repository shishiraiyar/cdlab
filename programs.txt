* Program 1: 
   * Write a LEX program to count number of words, lines, characters and whitespaces in a given paragraph.
   * Write a YACC program to recognize strings of the form anbn+mcm, n,m>=0.
* Program 2:
   * Write a LEX program to count number of Positive and Negative integers and Positive & Negative fractions.
   * Write a YACC program to validate and evaluate a simple expression involving operators +,- , * and /.
* Program 3:
   * Write a LEX program to count the number of comment lines in a C Program. Also eliminate them and copy that program into a separate file.
   * Write a YACC program to recognize a nested (minimum3levels)FOR loop statement for C language.
* Program 4:
